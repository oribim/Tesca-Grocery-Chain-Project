# TESCA GROCERY CHAIN PROJECT üè¨

## Background:
Tesca is a grocery store chain which consists of 830 stores in 74 states across North America and Europe. The company tracks its daily sales through a point of sales system. Bar codes are scanned directly into the cash registers‚Äô POS System by the Sales person. In instances where a sales person is required to work overtime, the overtime hours are captured in an Excel spreadsheet by the Sales Manager

The Purchasing department procures and receives products from certified vendors. These products are then distributed to the various stores. The product list consists of 40 products in 7 departments, such as frozen foods and diary. Products on sales are promoted via coupons, temporary price reductions, ads, and in store promotions.

The Human Resources Department tracks employee misconduct and absence data in CSV files which are uncleaned with many duplications, and anomalous absence and misconduct data.
Below are the de-duplication business rules:

‚Ä¢ The first entry of the absence data for a day is the right record to be retained

‚Ä¢ The last entry of the employee misconduct data for a day is the right record to be retained
